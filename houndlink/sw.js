/* HoundLink service worker.

   Purpose: make the app work with no network at all, which is the honest state
   for a tool whose whole job is talking to a USB device offline. It is NOT here
   to sync anything, because there is nothing to sync with.

   Two properties this file must never lose:

   1. SCOPE. It is registered from web/houndlink/ with scope "./", so it can only
      ever see requests under /houndlink/. The existing ESP Web Tools flasher at
      the site root is outside this scope and cannot be intercepted, cached or
      broken by anything here. That separation is deliberate: the flasher must
      keep working exactly as it did before this app existed.

   2. NO NETWORK EGRESS. Nothing here fetches a third-party origin, and the
      cross-origin case is explicitly passed straight through rather than being
      cached or rewritten. Combined with the page's Content Security Policy,
      "HoundLink never uploads anything" stays true even for requests that would
      go through the worker.
